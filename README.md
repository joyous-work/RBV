#### This branch repo shows how to enumerate a key that converts between Cumulated verse number and BCV coordinates, and how to use this key to generate sample data, which are then used to compare the two methods of selecting a random NT verse.

Level: Assumes basic familiarity with Microsoft Excel 2019 and Excel VBA. 

#### Contains two workbooks, with a pdf describing steps to reproduce them.

Other demonstrated functionalities include:
  * Use of INDEX and MATCH functions
  * Declaring and invoking VBA subprocedures with optional arguments
  * Exception handling in VBA
  * Insertion of charts (histogram), and customization of chart elements
  * Use of table filter to analyze data
  * Pivot Table and Charts to summarize and visualize data

#### Steps outlined in RNTV-Enumerate-Key.pdf:
1. Load Data
2. Enumerate Key
3. Generate sample data with key
4. Preliminary comparison of the two methods
